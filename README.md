# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews  

This project involves building machine learning models to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The models are trained using supervised learning techniques and evaluated on multiple performance metrics.  

## Features  
- Built sentiment classifiers using Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes models.
- Applied TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction from text.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualized performance with graphs and confusion matrices.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, NLTK  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Removed punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.  
   - Performed stemming to normalize words.  

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Converted text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Trained Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest models on the processed data.  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - Generated confusion matrices and visualized results with graphs.
